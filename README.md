a.	This algorithom checks a list to see if there are any numbers that are the same. If there is it returns true and if there's nothing the same it returns false.

b.	Because in the worst case scenario it will have to check through both list's i and j to get the result of true.

c.	Because it's the same list so there would be no variation in size.

d.	This algorithum will run twice as fast because it is only calling the list size once.

e.	The algorithum is still quadratic as the processes are still the same its now just faster.

f.	Pythons time complexity of its sort function is O(nlogn) https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-time-complexity-of-the-Python-built-in-sorted-function

g.	This algorithum is liniar because it is checking itself for dupicates incrementing by 1 each time. There is a O(nlogn) in there however its capped at the spead of the linear code.

h.	The second procedure is faster as speed and time is constant whereas the longer a quadratic algorithum lasts the slower it becomes.

i.	A programmer might choose a slower algorithum to have a smaller impact on the computers processing power.
